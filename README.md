# Random-Forest-model
This project will contain an intro to the Random Forest model with examples and coding.

A Random Forest model is a powerful machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. Itâ€™s known for its robustness, versatility, and ability to handle large datasets with many variables.

Handling of diverse data types: Random Forest can handle both categorical and numerical data, which might be present in your dataset.

Robustness to overfitting: By averaging the results of different trees, it reduces the risk of overfitting, a common problem in machine learning models.

Importance of features: It provides insights into the importance of different features in making predictions. This could help identify key factors leading to cancellations.

Non-linearity: It can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features, which could be useful if cancellations are influenced by such relationships.
